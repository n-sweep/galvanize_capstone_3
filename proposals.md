# Galvanize Capstone Proposal #3

1. MTG CV Color Prediction
    1. For many players, the most iconic part of a card, famous, infamous or just a personal favorite, is the card's artwork. *Magic*'s  publisher hires talented artists to paint stunning landscapes, horrible monsters and valiant heros for each new card it prints. With the uniqueness of each piece, seasoned players can recognize a card with only a short glance. It's even common for players and collectors to have their favorite cards autographed by the artist who helped create the card.  
    Many aspects of a card are used as inspiration by an artist to create an appropriate work, such as the color of the card. The game of *Magic* has five colors among its cards (somewhat analogous to playing card suits), and these colors typically follow some loose themes. Green often has artwork of forests, elves and beasts. A red card's art might include mountains, dragons and fire.  
    For this project I will use image data from Scryfall.com's [image API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/images) to build a predictive model.
    2. Can a card's color be predicted by the piece of art that was made for the card?

2. MTG Smart Deckbuilder
    1. Over the course of *Magic*'s nearly 30 year history and catalogue of tens of thousands of unique cards, players have found many different ways to play the game. As the game grew and old cards became more scarce, the idea 'format' was introduced. A format includes a set of extra rules that govern how a player's deck can be built and, to a lesser extent, how the game is played.  
    This project will focus on the 'Commander', a subtype of a format called 'Highlander,' which restricts players to only one copy of each card in their deck (typically 4 copies are allowed) and requires a minimum deck size of 100 cards (typically 40 or 60.)  
    A Commander deck also includes a commander (or *key*) card, chosen by the player, around which the deck is built and all cards in the deck must match the color of the commander.
    2. For this project I will build a model that will construct a deck based on a 'key' card given by the user, among other inputs.

3. Uncertain
    - I had a lot of fun doing Capstone 2 and would love to do another project related to the music industry, but nothing comes to mind.
